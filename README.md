# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

# Unironically not ashamed to make this public

This is the source code for my web security uni project, minus the .env, db, modules or the certificates.
As far as first-time attempts at making things go, I think it's not that bad.

If for some reason you want to fork it and host it yourself, go take a peek at the t3 link and follow the docs to set up your own auth.
